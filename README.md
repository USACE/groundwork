# Groundwork React Components

Groundwork provides a basic set of React components designed for use by USACE. We're working on making all of the components as accessible as possible to provide a consistent foundation for public-facing or internal applications.

See the documentation at https://usace.github.io/groundwork.

The library is available on NPM at `@usace/groundwork` - watch the version numbers on the releases, we push a new npm package on release.  You can update by running `npm install @usace/groundwork@<version>`  sometimes NPM is picky about updating as it tries not to break your project.  If all else fails, `npm uninstall @usace/groundwork` then do a fresh install.
